# Fourier — Auth (Matrix-Gated Media Proxy) Dev Log

**Project:** Fourier · **Component:** Auth (platform-gated media auth & token broker)
**Location:** /opt/fourier/auth/
**Status:** Live. Danbooru integration wired (media gate proven end to end), and
authentication migrated from Matrix password-grant to OIDC/PKCE against MAS.

> **IMPORTANT — sections 1–8 below describe the ORIGINAL password-grant design
> and are partially SUPERSEDED.** The authentication model in particular
> (§5 "Login: Matrix password grant", and the password-related parts of §2 and
> §7's provider seam) was replaced on 2026-06-14. See the new section **"9.
> OIDC migration (MAS / MSC3861)"** at the bottom for the current state. The
> architecture, session model (§4), and security guarantees (§6) remain
> accurate; only the login mechanism changed. Read §9 before acting on §5.

## 1. Purpose

fourier-auth gates access to media so that only users who can prove a valid Matrix
identity — and who have permission in Matrix to see a given image — can retrieve it. It
exists to close the gap that the booru currently serves media openly (/data/ static
files, no auth).

The design principle driving it: Danbooru stores metadata and a pointer (the MXC URI),
not the media bytes. All image bytes live in Synapse's R2 and are served through this
auth proxy, which enforces the viewer's Matrix permissions on every request. Synapse
remains the single authority for both storage and authorization.

---

## 2. Architecture

Browser (booru page) sends GET /media/<server>/<mediaId>?thumb=1 carrying the
fourier_session cookie. fourier-auth resolves the session cookie to a Matrix token via
fourier-redis, then calls the Synapse authenticated media API with that token. Synapse
enforces that the token is valid AND the user shares the room the media is in, returning
the image bytes (streamed back) or 401/403 if not permitted.

Key property: the Matrix token is never exposed to the browser. The browser only ever
holds an opaque session id (cookie); the token lives server-side in Redis.

### Provider seam (future-proofing)

Login is structured behind a provider interface (providers.js). A provider authenticates
a user and yields { matrixUserId, matrixToken }. Matrix (password grant) is the first and
currently only provider. Future providers (SSO/OIDC, other platforms) implement the same
shape, so the session and gate layers never need to know which provider was used. This
keeps the architecture dynamic for Fourier's planned multi-platform growth.

---

## 3. Files

All under /opt/fourier/auth/:

- index.js — Express app: /healthz, /login, /logout, and the /media/... proxy gate
- session.js — Redis-backed sessions: create, resolve, destroy; opaque id -> Matrix token
- providers.js — Provider interface + MatrixProvider (password grant against Synapse /login)
- redis/docker-compose.yaml — Dedicated fourier-redis (ephemeral, capped, loopback-only in dev)
- DEPENDENCIES.md — Cross-cutting version/dependency manifest for the whole stack
- package.json / package-lock.json — Node deps: express, ioredis, axios, cookie-parser

---

## 4. Sessions

- Opaque session id = 32 random bytes (crypto.randomBytes), unguessable.
- Stored in Redis as session:<id> -> { matrixUserId, matrixToken, createdAt }.
- TTL: 24h default (SESSION_TTL), auto-expiring in Redis.
- The browser cookie (fourier_session) is httpOnly, sameSite=lax.
- Logout (/logout) deletes the Redis key and clears the cookie — proven to immediately
  revoke media access.

### fourier-redis

- redis:7-alpine, dedicated instance, its own fourier-redis_net network.
- Ephemeral: persistence disabled (--save "" --appendonly no). A restart logs everyone
  out (acceptable) and avoids storing Matrix tokens on disk.
- Capped: --maxmemory 256mb --maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru.
- Not host-published in production — only a loopback port (127.0.0.1:6379) for host-based
  dev. Remove/keep loopback-only once auth is containerized.

---

## 5. Login (current: Matrix password grant)

- POST /login with { provider?: "matrix", username, password }.
- MatrixProvider calls Synapse /_matrix/client/v3/login (m.login.password), with
  initial_device_display_name "Fourier" so these sessions are identifiable in the user's
  Matrix device list.
- On success: returns { matrixUserId, matrixToken, deviceId }, a session is minted, the
  cookie is set.
- On failure: Synapse's error is passed through as 401.

Acknowledged limitation: the user types their Matrix password into a Fourier form, which
means Fourier sees it in transit (not stored). Acceptable for trusted/admin users; to be
replaced by an SSO/OIDC provider before opening to general users.

---

## 6. What was proven (host testing)

Tested on the host AND container-to-container (from inside a Danbooru container,
the path the integration will use) against the live Synapse and fourier-redis:

- Valid login -> session -> thumbnail fetch: 200, correct JPEG.
- Valid session -> full image fetch: 200.
- Synapse thumbnail endpoint confirmed working and auth-gated (the design hinge — means
  no resizer needs building; Synapse generates thumbnails).
- Security guarantees verified:
  - No cookie -> 401
  - Bogus session id -> 401
  - Valid session but invalid underlying token -> 401 (Synapse refuses)
  - Wrong password -> 401, no session minted
  - After logout, previously-valid session -> 401

---

## 6b. Containerization

- Image: node:22-slim, production deps only. Container name `fourier-auth`.
- Joins three external networks: synapse_default (reach Synapse), danbooru_default
  (reached BY Danbooru's nginx as http://fourier-auth:8010), fourier-redis_net (reach Redis).
- Config via environment: SYNAPSE_URL=http://synapse:8008, REDIS_URL=redis://fourier-redis:6379,
  PORT=8010, SESSION_TTL=86400. No host port published.
- fourier-redis loopback port (127.0.0.1:6379) removed now that auth reaches Redis over the
  internal network. Redis is fully internal, no host exposure.
- Proven container-to-container from inside danbooru-danbooru-1: health (redis:true), login,
  and gated thumbnail fetch all 200 over the Docker network.

---

## 7. Deferred / what's next

1. Wire Danbooru's image URLs to the gate (Step 5). The remaining integration. Requires
   modifying Danbooru's OpenResty config so /data/ (currently open static files mapped to
   /images/) routes through fourier-auth instead, and rewriting how Danbooru renders image
   URLs to point at the gate keyed by MXC. Most invasive part — modifies third-party
   software, not Fourier's own code.
2. Device cleanup on logout/expiry. Every login creates a new Matrix device. Logout (and
   ideally session expiry) should call Synapse logout to invalidate that device/token, or
   the user's device list accumulates "Fourier" entries indefinitely.
3. SSO/OIDC provider. Replaces password-grant for general users; slots in behind the
   existing provider seam without touching session/gate code.
4. Map post -> MXC at request time. The gate currently takes server/mediaId directly; the
   Danbooru integration needs to resolve a booru post to its MXC and produce gate URLs.

---

## 8. Operational reference

Auth service (host dev):
  cd /opt/fourier/auth
  SYNAPSE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8008" REDIS_URL="redis://127.0.0.1:6379" PORT=8010 node index.js

fourier-redis:
  cd /opt/fourier/auth/redis
  docker compose up -d
  docker compose ps

Health:
  curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8010/healthz   (-> {"status":"ok","redis":true})

- Synapse authenticated media endpoints used:
  /_matrix/client/v1/media/download/<server>/<id> and .../thumbnail/<server>/<id>
- Session cookie: fourier_session (httpOnly)
- Default ports: auth 8010 (dev), redis 6379 (loopback dev only)

## 9. Bearer mode + public gateway — mxc.41chan.net (2026-06-26)

Added a second way into the /media token broker so first-party clients (Technetium)
use the gate without a fourier_session cookie, and exposed the gate publicly.

Code (index.js):
- /media/:serverName/:mediaId resolves the upstream Matrix token from EITHER
  `Authorization: Bearer <MAS token>` (header wins) OR the fourier_session cookie.
  Synapse stays the final authority (invalid token 401s through). Booru cookie
  path unchanged — additive, backward-compatible.
- CORS: new CLIENT_ORIGINS env (comma-separated allow-list); applyMediaCors()
  reflects ACAO for listed origins + OPTIONS preflight. Header-based, so NO
  Allow-Credentials (no cross-origin cookies).

Compose / deploy:
- ports ["127.0.0.1:8010:8010"] (loopback publish; matches every other service).
- CLIENT_ORIGINS=http://127.0.0.1:5173 (Technetium dev).

Ingress:
- Caddy (HOST systemd process, not in the Docker stack):
  mxc.41chan.net { reverse_proxy localhost:8010 }  — LE cert auto-provisioned.
- Cloudflare DNS: mxc.41chan.net, proxied.

Verified: unauth -> 401 {"error":"no valid session or bearer token"};
valid Bearer -> 200 image/jpeg; ?w=320 snaps to ALLOWED_THUMB_SIZES.

Note: public route is /media/:server/:id?w=<px>, distinct from the upstream
Synapse paths (/_matrix/client/v1/media/{download,thumbnail}) the gate proxies to.

## 9. OIDC migration (MAS / MSC3861) — 2026-06-14

**Supersedes the password-grant auth described in §5 (and the password parts of
§2 and §7).** The session model (§4), the gate architecture (§2's proxy
behavior), and the security guarantees (§6) are unchanged and still accurate.

### Why this changed

The homeserver was migrated to delegate authentication to
matrix-authentication-service (MAS) under MSC3861 (see the separate
`MAS_DEVLOG.md` in /opt/synapse/). Once Synapse delegates auth, it no longer
honors the legacy `m.login.password` grant that `MatrixProvider` relied on —
fourier-auth's password login began returning 401 for valid credentials. This
forced (and enabled) the move to a proper OIDC redirect flow, which had always
been the intended end state: the original §5 explicitly flagged the
password-in-transit model as a stopgap "to be replaced by an SSO/OIDC provider."
That concern is now resolved — fourier-auth never sees a password.

### What the provider seam bought us

The provider abstraction (§7) paid off exactly as designed: the session and gate
layers did not change at all. Only `providers.js` (new provider) and the
`/login` + `/callback` routes in `index.js` changed.

### New flow (Authorization Code + PKCE)

1. `GET /fourier/login` → builds a MAS authorize URL with PKCE, stashes the
   state + code_verifier in Redis (single-use, 10-min TTL), and redirects the
   browser to MAS.
2. User authenticates at MAS (`auth.41chan.net`) and consents.
3. MAS redirects to `GET /fourier/callback?code=&state=`.
4. fourier-auth validates state, exchanges the code at MAS's token endpoint
   (with the code_verifier), and receives an access token.
5. **The MAS access token is a valid Matrix token under MSC3861.** A
   `whoami` call resolves the user id; a session is minted exactly as before;
   the gate uses the token against Synapse's authenticated media API unchanged.

### Code changes

- `providers.js`: added `OidcProvider` — `discover()` (lazy
  `.well-known/openid-configuration`), `authUrl()` (PKCE S256 challenge,
  scope `openid urn:matrix:org.matrix.msc2967.client:api:*` — the scope is what
  makes MAS issue a Matrix-API-capable token), and `exchange()` (code → token →
  whoami). Hand-rolled with `axios` (no new dependency). `MatrixProvider`
  retained but **non-functional under delegation** — slated for removal.
- `index.js`: `/login` changed from `POST` (JSON) to `GET` (redirect); added
  `GET /callback`. Session-minting and the media gate are byte-for-byte the same.
- `session.js`: added `putOidcState`/`takeOidcState` (single-use Redis storage
  for in-flight PKCE state) and a Redis `error` handler. The handler carries a
  comment explaining the expected host-side `ECONNREFUSED` spam when the module
  is load-tested on the host before containerization (Redis is internal to the
  Docker network; not a fault — use `node --check` to load-test without
  connecting).

### Config / secrets

- OIDC client credentials are supplied via environment, sourced from a
  **gitignored `.env`** via compose substitution (`${OIDC_CLIENT_ID}`,
  `${OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET}`) — NOT hardcoded in the tracked `docker-compose.yaml`.
  Env vars: `OIDC_ISSUER`, `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`,
  `OIDC_REDIRECT_URI`, `POST_LOGIN_REDIRECT`.
- The fourier-auth client is statically registered in `mas/config.yaml`
  (id, secret, redirect `https://booru.41chan.net/fourier/callback`).

### Gotchas encountered

- **Stale build / mislaid file:** an early edit of `providers.js` was written to
  the wrong working copy; the build faithfully shipped the old file and `/login`
  threw "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'authUrl')" (provider not
  registered). Verify edits landed on the file the build's `COPY` reads
  (`realpath providers.js`), and confirm the running container has them
  (`docker compose exec auth grep -c "oidc: OidcProvider" providers.js`).
- **Consent-screen client name:** shows the raw client ULID, not "Fourier", due
  to upstream MAS issue #4415 (static clients' `client_name` not synced).
  Worked around by a sidecar in the Synapse stack — see `MAS_DEVLOG.md` §7.

### Deferred (updated)

- Remove `MatrixProvider` (dead under delegation).
- Device cleanup on logout/expiry — now MAS-managed; confirm behavior.
- The original §7 "deferred" list's items 1 (wire Danbooru's image URLs) is
  DONE (the chanbooru fork's media-gating routes through this gate); item 3
  (SSO/OIDC provider) is DONE (this section).
